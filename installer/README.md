# Public website

`tools/make_channels.py` builds the stable installer, opt-in beta installer and
update pointers. The same files are published at both the project Pages address
and the account root. No firmware release is needed for website changes.

The pages are written in React with Next.js, in `site/` (pages router, static
export). `site/components/Layout.js` holds the shared navigation, footer and chat;
`site/pages/` holds one component per page. The pages ship no Next.js runtime
(`unstable_runtimeJS:false`): the behaviour stays in `assets/site.js` (language,
flasher, live statistics and the home page's fleet table, chat) and
`assets/discovery.js`, and the styles in `assets/site.css` and
`assets/discovery.css`. After changing `site/`:

```
npm ci --prefix site
npm run build --prefix site
```

The build exports the complete pages to `installer/site/`, which is committed and
checked by CI. `tools/make_site_pages.py` fills their placeholders (`__VERSION__`,
`__BOARDS__`, `__SITE_DATA__`, page key and title) for each channel and writes
`index.html`, `start.html`, `boards.html`, `flash.html`, `demo.html`, `faq.html`,
`releases.html`, `stats.html`, `gallery.html` and `support.html`. Links stay
relative, so the same files work at the account root, under `/BDLMinerV2` and
under `/beta`. The header/footer navigation and language preference are shared.
Old home-page section links redirect to their matching page. The board comparison
links to `flash.html?board=<profile>`, where only known profiles can be selected.
The site opens in the dark theme; a button in the bar selects the light theme.

## Discovery content

`content.json` supplies the board comparison, donation destination, release
highlights and reviewed community gallery. The site's English/French copy is
in `assets/discovery.js`. Keep measured hashrates tied to the evidence linked in
each board entry; leave unmeasured targets without a `rate` value.

`pool_names` and `pool_links` describe the recognised public pool groups and their
official website links. Keep them aligned with `BDLMiner-stats/src/pools.js`.
Links must use HTTPS on the group's public domain, without credentials, query or
fragment. Never add links for `other` or `unknown`, or use an endpoint from a report.

The support link is the owner's supplied GitHub Sponsors address. No address
from a pool configuration or statistics sample is reused as a donation address.
Bitcoin/Lightning fields are optional and remain empty unless supplied by the
owner. A site with no configured donation destination hides the support section.

Identification images and their source licences are in `assets/boards/`.
They are distinct from community submissions and physical BDLMiner measurements.

## Community photos

The gallery starts empty. The site's submission button opens
`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/community_setup.yml`; publication requires manual review,
the author's permission, an attribution, the board model and the original
Reddit/Discord link. No public upload endpoint or automatic publication is added.

After review, save an optimized photo under `installer/assets/community/` and add
an entry to `content.json`:

```json
{
  "board": "M5StickC Plus2",
  "image": "assets/community/approved-setup.webp",
  "credit": "Contributor's chosen name",
  "caption": {"en": "Contributor-approved description", "fr": "Description approuvée"},
  "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bdlminer/comments/POST_ID/",
  "permission": true
}
```

Keep the permission record in the submission. Do not invent installations or
reuse other people's photos without permission.

## Interactive demos

`tools/make_site_demo.py` copies the actual miner dashboard, settings/log pages
and fleet hub browser assets into `demo/miner/` and `demo/hub/`. Demo-only
`demo.js` supplies fictional in-memory responses and simulated settings. It
never forwards API calls. A Content Security Policy with `connect-src 'none'`
blocks network connections from those documents. Maintenance actions are not
offered in the miner demo; hub hardware-only operations explain that a real
miner is required.

The demo banner, reserved example addresses and fictional boot ID distinguish
these readings from real measurements. These generated copies do not modify
the firmware interfaces or expose a local miner through the public site.

Run the packaged-site browser checks with `node test/web/test_site.cjs`, and
the builder tests with `python3 -m unittest discover -s test/tools -p test_site_builder.py`.
